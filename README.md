# Coding Pirates Rødovre - GoDot - Fall 2024
Github Repository for GoDot Project in Coding Pirates Rødovre in the Fall of 2024.

## Contributing

At each point in time, the repository will be maintained by the volunteers teaching the material. These will be the only ones contributing, yet any other user will be allowed to clone the repository to their local machine to obtain the latest state of what we have been building.

A suggested way of working for the volunteers is to make a branch for a given week, make changes in a number of commits to this branch, finally merging the changes in a squash commit. This will make it easier to manage the commit-history, especially if planning to share with the younglings.

## Material
Here we will add a brief description (like a changelog) detailing the material of a given week and what updates have been made in the repository in a descriptive fashion.

### Week 1 - 4th September
- ?

### Week 2 - 11th September
